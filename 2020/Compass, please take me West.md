Compass, please take me West\
In a hurry to go nowhere\
Retrieval of the furious sword\
In all of its silliness\
Pray before us, pray then\
Lose your soul to irreverance\
Second after second will slice you\
Without unspoken sacrifice toward Heaven\
Nothing new, only true\
Says she who sat and listened\
Feel forever, express never / Only to drown in the distance\
