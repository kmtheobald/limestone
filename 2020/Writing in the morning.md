Writing in the morning\
Reveal the hidden word\
Sunlight charges the Earth\
Scripture for the absurd\
Medication for the hand\
Switch the actual and the imagined\
Bend "what is" toward magenta\
Create a frenzy of skeletal magic\
A neck for the coyote to suck\
Another neck for Anubis to suck\
The cactus will end what we don't\
Honeysuckles rule our lives\
I mean, surely we don't\
