Let go of my dangling string, if you must\
And then I will let go of yours\
There isn't anything left, not of us\
We ought not search for something more

I can only envision, what could have been?\
Who in the clouds above would know?\
If the two of us hadn't reached our end\
Disconnected romance

Now we may say our last goodbyes\
Move onward to a new life West\
Downward the fall before upward the rise\
The rhythm of healing rinses the mess

Forever and always, we shall remain\
In soul and in spirit, two youngling saps\
Rooted in places where we cannot stay\
Until the love that holds us finally cracks
