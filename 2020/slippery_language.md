Slippery language in the air\
Reach, reach for it, if you care\
Reach all you wish, it is no longer there

The music is finally over\
Listen for the notes, if you care\
Listen all you wish, its no longer there

On a whim, our brightness dims\
Look in the dark, if you care\
Search all you wish, its no longer there
