A friend might sell you something sweet\
Some candy upon his first word (then)\
A golden apple should you meet –\
Pomegranates from his orchard\
Will entice you to fall asleep\
Not with a thought would he then wait\
To carry home your soul a-slumber\
His lair the final stop of fate\
You’d think yourself pretty dumb\
Having entertained his kind date\
A sightly sugar seems to soothe\
But you may find you cannot move\
And, lo, your new eternal home\
Leaves you locked in the catacombs\
