How many have died of thirst, unable to bring upon\
a spring to nourish themselves or their creations?\

How many have had liquid life taken from them by\
greedy others whom could do nothing but hoard and drink?\

Worst of all, how many have drowned -- producing too many\
tears to stay on solid ground? After all, humans can only wade\
for so long before we sink. The most terrible of our hours are enough\
to take away that most precious.\

Can you not imagine the pressured jet Michelangelo must've focused\
on marble to chisel out David from the stone?\

Boys and girls grow to harness their force, their water, to change the world.\
May they learn well - us adults are testaments to how the phase of matter that\
allows us to bloom also allows us to wilt.\
