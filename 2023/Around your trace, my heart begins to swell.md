Around your trace, my heart begins to swell\
like ocean waves against the shore do beat\
Coursing inside my veins, the blood makes break\
the news of your arrival fast and sweet.\

Enlarged like this, my heart can do great things\
for you like spinning webs and counting leaves\
A glimpse of eyes would launch my ship of thieves\
who conquer lands. For you, your voice that sings\

Sings loud, sings clear the grace of womankind\
The debt that men do owe you grows each day\
I plan to pay by spinning webs, counting leaves\
for you, now that you're drawing near with speed.\

Accept my hand and clasp my fingers tight\
Around your glow, my mind begins to whirl\
like ballerinas taking flight, en pointe,\
Inside my brain excite dreams of a girl.\

And lithe like this, my mind can do great things\
for you like spinning webs and counting curls\
A touch of chests would free my soul in chains\
to protect you against this jealous world\

Of sin, for you, your smile that lingers tall\
Tall like the mountain peaks and plush your lips\
When men look up they see your beaming teeth\
as Constantine before he changed the world.\

Around your love, my body proves its youth\
like Icarus flown close about the Sun\
For you, would melt all Herculean tasks\
I'd labor long to feel your dear embrace.\

Near you so young, my arms can do great things\
for you, they'd build monuments high and bright.\
My legs they'd walk the Earth around and back\
to hear once more your pretty, ugly laugh.\

The debt that men do owe you grows each day\
I plan to pay by spinning webs, counting leaves\
for you, my sweet, who took a chance on me\
A sweep of hair would calm my worried sleep.\

Though we grow old and time does sink its fangs\
Deeper and deeper so to poison life\
For you, your faith, I can still do great things\
Honey, forever my beautiful wife.\

My mind still whirls, body still moves for you\
like summer clouds take shape and dance in sky\
But death lurks close so let us take a chance\
And try so that always we'll live and hide\

Place flat your hand onto my chest and press\
Until you break through to my beating heart --\
Take hold and remove mine, as yours it is\
And our Love's leaves will never wilt, apart.\
