As much as I desire to sit and sulk\
because my life is hard or fate again\
drew, for my strife, the shortest straw - I think\
of future me and who he will be, then.\

The man who'll rise in a short five years time -\
which nights defined his path from yesterday?\
Ones spent asleep, in tears, wishing for light or\
ones while wide awake he dreamt of rain.\
