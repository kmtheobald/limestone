Is this line I walk a starting one?\
Or is it there for all who feel free?\
Will I hear a shot from a heavy gun?\
Or can we roam and desire and be?\
You see, many races I’ve lost and won\
None; yet I adorn Nike’s wreath divine\
A mad dash has rather a boyish touch\
And this spry man knows better than to tire\
By sprinting nowhere just for a dumb rush\
They’ll say, “There’s always a winner, that’s life’s bind!”\
Fine – perhaps – though we all go the same way,\
Let this line be the finish of their game\
Our dear goals do not care when but if\
We cross. They can wander but mustn’t drift.\
