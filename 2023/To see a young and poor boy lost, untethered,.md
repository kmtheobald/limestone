To see a young and poor boy lost, untethered,\
Hardly a rag to wear or crumb to eat,\
And beaten down by peers, their bad weather\
A wilderness to be thirteen, alone of\
What shelter found abided by hard spine.\

Strength not in numbers but in letters numbered\
His birthright in ancient tongues\

One cannot hear books but nevertheless they shout,\
"Imprimatur! Imprimatur!"\

Unease be damned, an idea is a soul to be set free:\
"Imprimatur! Imprimatur!"\

If scrolls could sing, what they shout -\
What mighty ring, if they'd let it all out?\
"Imprimatur! Imprimatur!"\

Your mind it writhes, your soul it sighs\
You hold it tight, but will not lie -\
"Imprimatur. Imprimatur."\
