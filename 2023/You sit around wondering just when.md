You sit around wondering just when\
you'll do this, get to that, with a blank stare\
But of course, you see, what you want is there\
Always further down, always 'round the bend\

This is for you to forget:\
The best concern not with what the future brings\
because Beautiful people love beautiful things\
Whereever one is, the other you'll find\
To remind you of love and calm your worried mind.\
