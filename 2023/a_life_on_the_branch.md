A life as the branch,\
Away from the trunk,\
Further still from the roots.

I know not the goal of my own grand self\
But to stand tall and catch the wind.

Water comes from the main stalk\
and nourishment, too.\
I've never asked questions.

But I do wonder\
and ask my friends\
what to make of\
this life on the branch.

They shrug,\
the most fruitful of branches,\
as the goal, whatever it is,\
isn't accomplished by thinking.

I guess the roots know what they're\
doing and the trunk plays its part as well.\
A leaf sprouts, the flowers bud, and fruits fall\
with seeds.\
Bees stop by to visit.\

But not for long -- they must have a goal too.\
But they look from out so I again ask from in

What is life as the branch?\
The busy bees, sprinkled with gold,\
simply cannot stop.

But I notice the sun shining its warming rays\
as when I was younger\
and when I'll be older.

I now understand what a branch means\
to a tree\
to the bees\
and to the Earth entire.
