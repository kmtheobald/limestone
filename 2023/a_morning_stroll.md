A morning stroll, displeased with morning dew\
A pen doesn't always speak what's true\
But mighty words forever\
Which mighty words do your life's sky imbue?

Many birds do little but sit and preen\
Others still spend their time only to call\
Some desperate need with life just to be seen

Us rats scurry to feed then scurry home

A morning stroll, displeased with morning dew,\
Make fun of the man in a bowler hat,\
You only think, "Don't do this, don't do that"\
Your mouth doesn't always speak what's true

Explore the well where rests your life anew\
Restoring drink away from thoughts so bad

A real door closing kind of day\
Before and after kind of day
