A partial list of things that language has never done

planted seeds\
harvested crops\
sailed seas\
laughed uncontrollably\
made love\
performed music\
flown in a balloon\
layed bricks\
modeled clothes\
played tennis

Instead, in its infinite mercy, it willed those things and gave us the credit.

waged war\
killed itself\
pierced armor\
dropped bombs\
spread disease

Instead, it its infinite cunning, it willed those things and gave us the credit.

No window takes a bow for the world it lets through\
Water had no comment on the life it allows\
The sun declined a patent for its bronzing rays\
And words shy from the camera when approached.
