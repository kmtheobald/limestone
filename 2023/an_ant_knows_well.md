An ant knows well it's selfless job to do\
Without a thought to bear about renown\
He fails who thinks his role is absolute\
For glory, ‘round the Queen, has draped her gown.\
A colony marches as one! as one!\
A worker’s life for solely sacrifice,\
A soldier’s fight the key to kingdom come,\
To bid the empire rise – death the fair price.\
Behold the earthmover so small in size\
Who carries lessons forth of great import:\
Of strength in number, will, and civic pride,\
As progress built has no idyllic sort.\
From simply looking down what might one gain\
In matters both of trust and world sustain?
