As exercise of will but more of mind
Since He who calls has left us here to fence
By man apart each heart of ours unkind.

A house, a lawn, and driveway marked by fence;
Good living quiet, same as living private
A fork in the road -- death -- all making sense.

On chairs in town, in air up high, I sigh
An exercise of will but more of mind
Ignore those swords that whistle toward your eye.

Le corbeau chante -- Again our hand demands
repentance; sin seeps from the floor touching our feet.
Contre nos ventres -- down on the ground we go
And the bird impatiently counts to one hundred.
Look! A beautiful cloud wispy and white. Or
perhaps saliva swirled within the blur.
Sixteen smacks found skin. Sixteen insults from God.

Une chaise cass√©e -- nothing that can't be repaired.
And when the Sun sets, there is always the moon who cares.
We are back to standing, eye to eye with the bird.
Sixteen minutes passed before we could say a word.
"Die", we said, we left, before sin could seep once more.
Deux mains qui construisent -- that is the core.
This God is not our brother, 
so we will find another.
