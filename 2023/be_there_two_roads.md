Be there two roads or be there three, ahead\
our lonely eye looks back on merely one;\
And since our physics cannot speak for self,\
so how we start sometimes means how we're done.

Still, nevermind the trunk, go stress the branch,\
Some leaves are golden while some others rot;\
The sun sure shines but then it also shades,\
the rays avoiding space where we are not.

Life has its forks but really it just twists\
and turns, direction found or lost on hue,\
And all along the way, that damn clich√©\
whispers softly in your ear its cold truth:\
left or right, right or wrong, or red or blue,\
so we are as we repeatedly do.

Reflect upon that fool resembling you\
In ten, twenty, thirty, fifty years time\
Temple resting on hand, eyes closed\
Will pass a fleeting smile but then a sigh.

Tending after grey-spined notebooks filled with days,\
That old fool, will once wonder but know\
what became of her, day in, day out,\
those choices which settled the question of who?
