There is beauty in death
A grimace, a melancholia, relief
are its three stages
The burning flame is quick to praise
but it's extinguish is just as insightful
A pinch, a sizzle, smoke
A gust, a crackle, ash

Death is a hint
that what is will not be:
Who stood where you now stand?
Your grandparents laughter echoes
Who stood, what were they doing?
Your laughter adds to the chorus
Who stood, where did they go?
So do your tears

Death is a reminder
Of the ride we are all on
And a reminder
to get off from time to time.
We all get dizzy, we all get sad --
We all get winded, we all get mad.
And a reminder
to always get back on
until the end.
We deserve happiness, we deserve peace
We deserve love, we deserve to be free.

There is beauty in death:
Keats breathed it in his lungs,
Sylvia thought it in her mind,
Frost learned it with age,
Emily wrote it with her pen,
Rimbaud felt it in his bones.
A grimace, a melancholy, relief
are its three stages.

Death is a promise
From me to you
From you to me
That there will be somewhere
When there is nowhere else to go
Together we exist
In a moment of time
And then we are gone
Like cars in traffic
Like electricity static
I promise not to go
Until I have to go.

Death is a cigarette
It burns and burns
Once lit --
Through the lungs
Up in smoke
Released tension
all that's to show
But some cigarettes are never lit.

There is beauty in death
A grimace, a melancholy, relief
are its three stages
The burning flame is quick to praise
but it's extinguish is just as insightful
A pinch, a sizzle, smoke
A gust, a crackle, ash
