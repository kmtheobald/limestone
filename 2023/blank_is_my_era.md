Blank is my era and empty my day\
To be filled yet with birthday balloons\
While air inflates lungs and senses awake at dawn\
I doubt beyond doubt that I will rest soon

Not the fatigue of sunken eyes or shaky knees\
Nor at the bottom of the coffee pot\
That cursed land I've never been nor will go\
That arrests the heart and mind -- shuddered land of stop.

This Earth I came into imperfect and uneven\
Such a shame we don't live longer than the turtles\
But long enough to paint brushes with our easels\
To lap the track and clear its stupid hurdles.

Your choice, I find, whether to jump over or move around\
A simple matter of taste like milk from a cow\
I choose to move around and spare myself the speed\
Though some are wide, some are also quite tall anyhow

Clean are my glasses but scuffed are my shoes\
In search of sights, certain things just won't stay neat\
Here comes the cliche, the most important line\
Simple acts ^like being a good person^ to improve the world are often the strongest feats

Let's buy some dynamite from the miners\
And detonate the world to level and nice\
Before we're done, the Earth we'll make perfect and even\
Otherwise, we'd worry without worry it won't smell of sweet spice.
