Will you blossom with me?\
Like a cherry tree\
in early April our leaves\
will finally express\
what we must say unless\
so, so excitedly\
our branches show it first.

Let's grow our cherries ripe\
and drop them down in sight\
of boys and girls alike --\
Then, once they eat, might sprout\
ideas, words, and sounds.\
New cherry trees, you see,\
for us all to enjoy.
