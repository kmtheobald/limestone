It's known that tinder makes nightly fire\
and birds and bumbling bees are nature's legion\
who cycle life, spread seed among the trees\
like Greece had grown to conquer, by the lyre.\
Surely many a child by bastard sired\
has petal picked in search of closure -- leaves\
from flowers whose nectar fed, unbereaved.\
The facts of life seem passionate desire.\
All well is true of mortal flame turned scorn\
but embers burn eternal, praised that bright\
Hestia stokes in gentle selflessness.\
Great blaze of phoenix pyre, to be reborn,\
is wrought with care by mourning angels' light\
while bleeding hearts fear Aphrodite's kiss.
