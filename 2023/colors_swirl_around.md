Colors swirl around, for now\
But in time they'll fade to gray\
We all stop spinning, at some point\
And sit at close of day.

The Acropolis stood bright and Blue\
When statesmen carried about their weeks\
But iron and smoke soon filled their lungs\
And the rocks began to bleach - the light escaped.

Dying stars only see in black and white,\
though long ago they burned Yellow and Red;\
Unable to turn, they curse their world\
That took away soul and left just head.
