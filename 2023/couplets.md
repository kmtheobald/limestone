Nigh is the time (now!) to unplug and turn off\
Race as if Death's shade you behind had you caught.

Erase the wretched, evil stench of sin\
From soul and body Satan hides within.

No matter setting Sun or deathly Night --\
Inside you'll find what's bright; your inner Light.

Belief that what is fought is never naught\
Rewards the Man who persevered and sought.

A wispy cloud let rain and rage in mind\
Makes mean the gentle human once so kind.

I hardly think of Rose's spirit since\
Our time together past but makes me wince.

Their sorrow knew not bound in time nor space --\
Two masks always obscured what showed on face.
