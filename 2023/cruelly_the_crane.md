Cruelly, the crane doesn't\
yearn to meet the skies\
nor is the worm hurried\
to learn the Earth.

Rather, reality gifts realm\
for one to lift and\
the other dig -- without\
second spared of worth.

Should the crane seek dirt\
or the worm search up\
we would laugh in vain --

As bystanders look\
And breaking soil shook\
And clouds leaked cold rain.
