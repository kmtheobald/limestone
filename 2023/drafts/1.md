Alone I wake, not beside my mate,\
For tricky is that fateful fate\
Taken away, too soon, too fast\
And now one hour cannot go past

That I don't think of her, her smile,\
and need to sit and stare awhile\
and cry and shout for a second more\
to spend with my amazing girl.

So whilst alone I sleep, my mind in search,\
for her I look in all imagination.

In life I find myself, without her grace,\
A lonely man amidst a lonely race\
To the desperate end, the final land\
and rest my feet in the endless sand

However here, in this magical time\
Her spirit alive remains divine\
Returned to me, for at least one dance\
And leave 

I have no more of you, my darling,

And for that reason I can see,\
A single man I would rather not be\
Beholden to you as I was and I am\
and now 

Her lively gait goes dancing in my dreams\
Her shadow faint is fading in my dreams\
Our grass we used to walk still parts for two\
And near the door are still her petite shoes

If just for today, only this night,\
we meet again and bask in the light;\
You I will hold, you I will kiss,\
for you are whom the most I miss.

I have no more of thy grace my darling\
And for that I can see,\
Such that rather than be\ 
once again a single man,\
The freest of free,


Forever and always, would I love to be,\
as I was and as I am: Beholden to thee.
