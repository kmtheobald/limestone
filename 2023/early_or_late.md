I imagine a future world in which\
I am judged harshly for my transgressions,\
yet unknown. To those Posterity rich,\
I only wish love and peace and passion.

I learned of a past brutish and bare\
Forged by those teaching that might must make right.\
O'er the ages found lumineers who dared\
preach: the good fight is a fight not at all.

Supreme reigns reason! Lay down your swords! shouts\
Lady Liberty, with her gown bloodied\
Nigh is the hour! Away with gunpowder!\
"Justice" is the word henceforth that shall be heard.

Confusion abound, nary an answer\
can be seen in our age of folly.\
The inflamed soul of reason finds refuge,\
Betrayed by the men who summoned her forth.

She can but go nowhere instead searching\
sometime when her talents will have effect.\
The pendulum will soon swing back - toward\
future strong born from those who don't know best.

Amongst mortals, the wisest do the same.\
Deliverance takes the shape of a date,\
Impossible to foresee - one must wait\
Impossible to be early or late.
