To peel words from their familiar clumps\
And fashion as pottery newly crafted phrases\
Novel lines that speak as novels\
Funny words expressing funny faces

To coin a phrase and turn that phrase into turns of phrases\
Idioms be not our friends, except with a nink and a wod

To withdraw from memory's vault our seemly dances\
Trace the contours of those daily routines\
And deposit again as well-rehearsed motions\
Worth more than Priam knew in golden Troy.

To breach decorum and betray the rhetorician\
who insists that meaning must always be pregnant\
who allows emotion to refuge in the commonplace\
where cycles of thought and belief idly rest.\
Thought must not rest.\
Belief must not rest.

Shakespeare endures not for one aching page\
but for soulful stories across the age.

To tear and recombine, churn and churn again,\
such that the foaming sea may not settle, ever.\
To stitch and unstitch hours into a moment's thought\
such that human courtship of Grace may not whittle, never.
