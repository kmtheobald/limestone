A street light flickers to the rhythm\
And the birds' wings flap to the melody;\
The worms all know something we don't:\
It's in the dirt where we really see.

The engines can rev as fast as they fast\
Go ahead and build as tall as you please\
When the rockets stop launching and fall to the sea\
We'll feel the soil, ears to the ground, and\
Fall asleep.

Still water attracts life because the waterfall\
is too much a rush;\
Monkeys swing fastest under the canopy\
But the desert receives the most sunlight\
The lions sneer as we chase after the stars\
Since the discovery they've always been in the sky

Our arms race only ends in the end, so\
Let the atoms speed and split to three\
Only once the programs stop executing\
Will we feel the soil, ears to the ground, and\
Fall asleep.
