How I would like to close my eyes and truly see\
How five senses conspire to burgle my mind's mind\
False colors swirl, take shape in a lie that lies\
to the face of my reality.

I shall take a deep breath and then a second\
A realization is a new beginning, if only the\
dice roll to their fateful side, unimpeded.

Left, right, left, right\
Shifting is not good enough, not good enough.\
The contours of spacetime do not follow such periodicity\
Nor shall I.

As the arrow shoots, a target is desperately sought after.\
I will soon pierce flesh or wall or\
soon wake up eyes wide and blind.
