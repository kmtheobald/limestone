London fog lifted and showed me your sign\
Is it true that you haste to come to rest\
Pendulum swinging back and forth up high?

If it's true, I can only sit and sigh\
Tell me why now you're slowing and with such zest?\
Nature's gloss faded and showed me your sign

This final jest of fate leaves my smile wry\
After grey years you say you've reached your crest\
Pendulum swinging back and forth in time?

I calmly curse the sky but dare not cry\
You really think you know what time is best?\
My God is dead for he willed me your sign

My things are packed they sink low in the sty\
I prepare, bent, a return to my nest\
Pendulum swinging back and forth, maligned.

In midst of life and fest, resigned to die,\
Together we sense your lay string arrest.\
The north star shifted, exposing your sign,\
Pendulum limp, you dearest friend of mine.
