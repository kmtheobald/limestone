(Sweating happily under the summer sun)

Maybe I'll see you again under the stringed lights
to push your hair back and give you a kiss
on the cheek.

Maybe I'll see you again and we'll hide between
the mountains. We'll watch the stars, waiting
until they move.

Maybe I'll see you again to ride bicycles
around the city, directionless, without a sense of time,
as in the nebula deep within your iris
when I look at you.

Maybe I'll see you again on a dare to eat
spoonfuls of spices. Laughing, laughing,
until we cannot breathe and we'll discuss
the latest music and forgotten music
and what we're going to do
and where we're going to go.
We will spin and spin and we won't stop
until vertigo makes us fall down.

Maybe I'll see you again, eye to eye, juste pour te dire:

<< Encore jamais on se verra. Encore jamain je te prendrai la main.
Notre temps dans l'étreinte de l'amitié et l'amour s'est écoulé. 
Merci pour tout. >>

Merci.
Merci.
Merci.
À demain.
