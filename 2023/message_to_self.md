What do I do? What do I do?\
These words are not mine, but rather copies of others'\
words. Others more creative than I, more hardworking\
and more learned.\
Will this be always? Will this be always?\
Just one original sentence would nourish me for life.\
A phrase, even! But it won't come. I am lost in\
a labyrinth of ideas and accomplishments out of\
which I cannot escape. With no string to guide\
me back, the minotaur hunts me.\
Why don't I hunt? Why don't I hunt?\
I desire, sure, but I do not express. Turn after turn leads\
to dead end after dead end. References, allusions are\
worthy weapons but they are inadequate. Anaphora, alliteration\
will not slay the beast. Rhyme scheme and meter\
will not find the door.\
Where am I at? Where am I at?\
Show, but do not tell. Lead, but do not yoke.\
Unveil, but do not expose. An enemy is defeated\
with know-how as much as force.\
How do I use? How do I use?\
I will close my eyes and keep looking.\
I will sit down and keep walking.\
The minotaur will find me too late; I will know\
my way.\
What is the way? What is the way?\
The way is my way. The beast is slain by me.\
A sword is merely my tool.\
The door is where I say it is. A maze is merely\
my game.\
Where will I go? Where will I go?\
I will show, but I mustn't tell.\
I will lead, but I mustn't yoke.\
I will unveil, but I mustn't expose.\
A novelty is unearthed with know-how as much as force.
