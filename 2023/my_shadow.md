My shadow departed from me, old friend\
But said we would see each other again\
And first, his goal he said, to see the town\
For too often, I'd given him the runaround

Alright, I replied, this is no matter\
You're free to go and do what you wish\
Just be mindful not to come back sadder

So he detached without a further hitch\
And the Sun shunned my presence out there -\
Left no choice but to wait and languish since.
