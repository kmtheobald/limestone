Do not punch your chest\
Do not kick your leg

A bird doesn't fly\
nor a flower grow\
nor a star glow\
busy questioning itself.

A train doesn't track\
nor a scull row\
nor a car go\
that is stuck, half in reverse.

Sweet friend, just know,\
you'll grow up twice.\
First, when your parents\
drop their act.\
And second, in the ruin,\
observing that obsidian glass, when\
you drop yours.
