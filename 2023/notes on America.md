when knights joust without armor nor honor\
lately sprung up in America\
a lonely column\
Who, left, sings America?\
Whispers grow of a brewing tempest\
fallen arch\
over the course of empire\
promises to repair\
positively incapable\
blaze of dishonor\


America is everybody\
It's him, it's her, it's me, it's you\
America is still a land of truth,\
Of contradiction and of artistry\

In fact, was this land made for you and me?\
Or was it always for, a greedy few?\
A country of cruel and rich, between two seas,\
Where with a little money you can eschew\
The law and its consequences\


"A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name\
Mother of Exiles."\

There is, America as I was taught\
of her, a mighty woman with a torch...\

And then, America as I grew up\
with her, an ugly, sour man with a gun\

Has she always hidden decay so well?\
Or is this rot new, or was it never hidden at all?\
