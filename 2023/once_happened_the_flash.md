Once happened the flash of a light but bright\
My miserly shadow gone in its wake;\
'Twas you, radiant, dress and mind alike,\
Who passed to forever alter my fate.\
A newfound faith, an impulse of might\
Led me with you to become acquainted.\
We laughed! We danced! to the music of time\
Destined, 'till death did us part, to make it\
But, alas, much a time later, a fight\
Empassioned love turned to embittered hate;\
Soon enough caused you, in tears, to take flight;\
Myself again a sorry sight to take.\
May we toast to the memory of our ghosts\
Who still know our past relation and boast.
