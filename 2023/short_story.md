I had nothing to say so I just said it.\
"You have beautiful eyes, miss. Where, may I ask, did you buy them?"

On the bench, the lady beside, less than amused at my question, retorted,\
"They were not bought. I hand-crafted them."\
This did not seem likely to me.

"Surely you joke. That shade of green hardly exists anymore. Your eyes must've been manufactured."

"Believe as you wish, son. I don't have the time to sit around and converse. My bus arrives in less than 3 hours." She consulted her watch to confirm that last statement.

Pushing the matter aside, I pressed on with the nothingless I felt compelled to say. "So and so got shot in the park two nights ago. I cannot imagine how he must be feeling. To die surrounded by all those trees would aggravate me to no end. Why, he might've been near a statue. The nerve of --"

In hindsight, it was wisdom that led the lady to interrupt me there. "Statues are perfectly fine. Son, you need to get your head straight."

"My head is quite round, thank you very much. And hand-crafted too. This hypothetical statue may be of someone I don't like. Now think about dying close to it."

The lady stated plainly, calmer than before, "There are more important things in life to consider. The murderer may have a lot of money."

That was the first thing she said that made any sense. "You've got that right. Where was I? That and the streetlights are dim. The world isn't what it used to be, I tell you."

"Of course it isn't, son. Time has passed."

"Don't you have a bus to catch?"

"Yes."

"Good point. So do I."

A puzzled look showed on the lady's face. "Where does the bus go, anyway?"

I pointed to the right with my left arm. "Over there. Whatever direction that is, though, is the wrong one."

"We'll have to be on the lookout. Or else the bus will pass us and we'll miss it." The lady spoke with a hint of uncertainty.

I felt a sense of guilt. I had to break the bad news to my newfound friend. "Sorry, lady, but no bus is coming by here. The buses never come."

"That's a shame. Nothing ever comes these days. Everything only goes."

Immediately behind us, a cat purred as if in agreement. However, I worried that it must've come from somewhere and that didn't bode well for the lady's point. She continued, "I'm staying put. Unlike other idiots running around today, I know when a problem needs more elbow grease to be solved. They all move too fast and you, son, may be mistaken. When this bus comes, I'll be here."

Evidently, she had nothing to say as well.\
"Good on you, miss. I wish you and your elbow the best of luck."\
I stood and began to depart, lastly adding, "You really do have beautiful eyes."

"Thank you. I am tired and have to close them soon but even then I'll keep looking."

Not five minutes later, walking home, I spotted a crew of men working across the way. What they were exactly doing was unclear, but I could make out what one yelled to the rest:\
"Chop down the Douglas fir!"
