We thought and thought until this last


My shadow departed from me, old friend
He just said, he had somewhere else to go


A glass half full still has ample space to explore
A glass half empty knows there's a long way to the bottom
A vector has both magnitude and direction
An errant key, if tried, may just unlock the kingdom


A hint of me I saw in you
(I wonder when it made that leap)
But only just a fleeting look
And then a flash, and it was gone,
A thief, that hint of you in me, it took


The haze that clouds all men's minds


Not life in service of getting smarter
But life in service of getting wiser


What you add or
What you facilitate


Je fixe mes deux mains pour assurer qu'elles ne se serrent pas.


An arm I praise loud! that does not bend back

-
A wave of time we pass on through and break
Built brick by brick by humans born before
Soon crashing overhead

I built this wave of time so high, so high
And now I'll break it down in rage, in rage
Almost it crashed on me, such waste, such waste
But rather I'd exit my cage, my cage
-


Run, run as fast as you can
Or you'll get caught by the gingerbread man
His hug been known to put children to sleep
His smile been known your soul to keep


Life if like a side tortilla
that's Worth 50 cents; pinto bean


High in the sky your judgement's soul must wait


Despite my youth left, I trust in your love.
That string you swing on, [Untitled 6]


Begin now and end never.


Out for a walk with Susan Stone


God himself once placed his bet
Whisper your cards, "all in"


Even though, I doubt our paths shall ever cross again


In quest to find the course of empire; I
Say to him: Carpe Diem, seize the day.


Together we shall cross the Rubicon
And march toward Rome, eyes shut tight, hand in hand.


They are out there and I hope to meet them.

I must recall to you a happenstance
occurred to me not many fortnights past.
Out for a stroll, came approaching Muses three
who carried by their side a bold decree.

That noble lady philosophy spoke
-


All in dogmatically
All in ferociously
All in to sprint
All in to fail
All in with a smile
All in with a scowl
All in with a smirk
All in with a howl


-
What does an October breeze mean to you?
Surely not those charging strides do you recall
Wind-swept hair

Let me tell you what it means to me --
A clarity in the air
A fear of greatness
A decision thrust upon me
-


A conduit of feeling


In the lone of night
The words that drip from pen


... my death draws near ...
... fingers grow already cold ...


In spite of shattered glass across the floor


Moons and junes and ferris wheels


Psst, come here, I want to tell you something


Die, die, I want this hour to lie
naked, dead, on the cold hard floor
Tomorrow we'll burn remains
Next week we'll throw them to the shore.


I should like to sit beside this here tree
And converse about life, just it and me.


Moment between moments
during which the heart fills,
the mind dances, and the soul sings.

Same patterns of perception
Mutual awe
Everyone growing up together

Open up those doors
Show me the horizon, and then bring it to me
my polka-dot princess

Don't you know? I can still hear the music
No matter how hard you try to pull me down
Don't you know? I can still hear the music

A little boy with his toy
I'll have an eternity to be dead once this is over,
ain't no stopping now
My mind feels right at home

The waters run mighty muddy tonight

We've created this memories, now watch us tear them down

I just wanna make some love, make some change
Met a nymph by name of Alexandria, over there by the river bank

You've reached your speed limit, detach

On this stone is written
A confession of love
Soon to be lost at sea
Exploded all around

Never once was there a choice
To see you one last time
Separation is our dominion
One thousand miles, a sigh


Math begins when we count after which point it does not stop

The peak elusive land of stop

**It happened suddenly but fluently**
The answer same as it ever was
Go west, young man. Go West.


Requiring not
Reason nor rhyme
But will to shout
Now is the time. 

The prism of truth has many sides


She heard one night the sound of honey
And never would forget the taste

Sublime Porte
cold comfort
Terra cotta

Each bullet shot in a school is a test:
In teaching children day by day to hear and
To speak our national language of death.

'Tis time, 'tis hour, to sprinkle pepper
over the sinks.


How'd this day arrive? How'd de come to die?
It's His world - I'm just borrowing it.


Just a train ride from me to her

By volition or escort

the palms of my hands affirm my existence
A gentle touch or a hard blow; their capacity
to build, to craft, to grasp...

Moment between moments
during which the heart fills
the mind dances and
the soul sings.

I should like to sit beneath this here tree
And converse about life, just it and me.


One is a lonely number
Like the chopstick in my drawer
Like a missing sock
Singular, singular


We're put on Earth for one and one purpose
alone -- to see the light of day before
slinking below the dirt where we belong.
We're put on Earth for one purpose alone
We rise to see the light of day.
