When we sat down did you think that would be\
the result?\
You and I so distant\
Seated next to one another in a garden\
Write with a light touch\
Keep lead spared from being crushed\
Better is done, not said.\
Inspire your next note.

You were the litigious sort, and I the type\
uninterested in some daily snipe.\
That said, so loyal you were, and endlessly\
inspiring. Hearing your voice, although gently\
gave commanding effect.
