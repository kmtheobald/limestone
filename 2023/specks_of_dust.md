As stars in sky us specks of dust\
On a perfect screen,\
burn, burn.\
If only to shine our light\
before we burst;\
or else the worst,\
we rot, we rust.

Alight the short end,\
Something spectacular -- though we fear the worst --\
the best and brightest\
free from the force,\
they expand and then\
they burst.
