The beat must first be heard\
With the honking of horns and the\
stomping of feet,\
With the flapping of wings and the\
clinking of glasses,\
the rhythm is never interrupted.\
It slows across the din of concrete and\
It softens when the sinners shout but\
the rhythm is never interrupted.

Ask the yellow-winged bird at sunrise and
it'll tell you with a knowing smile that
all that matters in this world is keeping
the beat. The beat that points and traces an
arc from start to star, painting the hunter.

The beat must next be seen.\
A painter's first canvas,\
a hermit tanless,\
Red sands a-heat,\
Bedlands of peet,\
all show the melody (dull\
in a grey suit, but sharp\
at the end of a rainbow).\
With the writing of words and the\
monuments built of stone and brick,\
the beat displays its color.

Ask the fronds of a palm tree amidst rain
from a raging spout behind heaven's eye
and they'll tell you, bruised, all that matters in
this world is keeping the beat. The beat that
phloem pulsates at to make green and color the world.

The lastly feat, to feel the beat, requires sacrifice.\
The arm must break, the heart must bleed\
to greet that sweet sensation.\
In the boxing ring of life, the beat finds itself\
in the Poet's corner.\
But all around us, all through us, all in us it emanates\
liminally, even if you don't meet it.\
The clocks know it, just ask them.\
The gravestones know it, just ask them.
