The starting line - a hundred boys abreast (or)\
In solitude – the pages blank of a test\
Across the room – the eyes of a lovely girl (or)\
Within my heart to bare the hidden pearl.

The common thread of failure haunts my mind\
I wasted years in fear and now I rue\
But not from laze nor threat of a heavy hand –\
I was scared of what I could really do.
