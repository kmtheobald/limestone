One is not the loneliest number but\
rather it is three: Odd like the rest,\
it has but the triangle for ceremony. Even\
when perfect, graphically, each point\
must choose which way to turn. A tension\
builds and cannot resolve until the unlucky\
shape collapses to scalene.

One is the mighty statue,\
One is the mighty Hercules!

Three is the triumvirate,\
three is the fated balcony.
