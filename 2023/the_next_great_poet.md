The crowd assembles nearing full\
Abound are pens and paper blank\
A multitude of faces bright\
Attention pulses forth in wait

There's excitement in the air\
Nary a person with a care\
All who came to see the fare\
You, the next great poet.

Loud whispers flash and flood en masse\
The room all dressed in Sunday best\
Once, this wild chance to visit fate\
and living proof it's not too late --

Have now no fear\
We'll lend you our ears\
If we can only hear\
You, the next great poet.

We check and check, we watch the time\
Any minute now, that first line\
Any second now, for God's sake\
That voice, those words which drum and quake

Up you go to the stage\
Now released from your cage\
Knowing life's but a page (is)\
You, the next great poet.
