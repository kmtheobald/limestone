This apple sweet that is yet mine to hold\
And slice and bite but not to now devour\
Already softens brown and ages old.

The price paid, for enjoying pretty flowers\
A souvenir of sun and lovely day\
No mind the rot, indeed, 'tis not a rust to scour

Though soon, restfully, on its side will lay\
Make no mistake, this fruit is far from waste\
The core is strong, much bent to take no sway

Perhaps in faith, I'll brave another taste\
Of sugar wrought from the flesh, without haste.

{For my apple has faith in me as well}\
{A scarlet might that would be death to sell\
Mine oh mine, flaws in all, heaven or hell.}
