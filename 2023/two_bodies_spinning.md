Two bodies spinning, in space,\
Around and around, in time, (apace?)\
Faster and faster, with love,\
meant always to merge, to one.

Gravity winks once—a wave—\
to consummate its promise.\
Celestial light—she runs,\
spreading news to other suns.

-----

out in the universe\
a silly dance\
two spinning bodies\
a lovely prance
