What thinks a bird in perch\
moment before the soar,\
talons curled and beak raised,\
wings anxious to unfurl?

"Hope for the best" is doubt\
unworthy of a plane\
who defies the decree\
of the vast Universe.

Perhaps mind might shout,\
"Now is time!" with force\
brainwave as destiny\
conduit of motion.

Or, rather, not a thought\
is thought. Commanding up\
as the Sun beats desert\
sky, should suffice for flight.
