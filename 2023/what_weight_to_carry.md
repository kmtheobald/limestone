What weight to carry\
for so long a weight\
in your outstretched hand.

And worse yet, it\
doesn't support itself -\
dead weight, sinking\
in your outstretched hand.

You clench and clench\
with all your might\
with hopes that one day\
what once was live\
in your enclosed arms\
will be magically revived.

But what's dead is said\
like what's said is said -\
this you must remember.\
No use is there to defy\
great gravity's line:\
all weights, in the end, do drop.

Fingers, trembling, slip into release\
feeling sweet relief as\
your outstretched hand returns\
to your embracing side.

What was there\
is no longer in your hand.\
It had been gone for a long, long time\
but at least, it\
is no longer in your hand.
