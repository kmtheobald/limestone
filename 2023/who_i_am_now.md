Amongst other things she broke us up\
because I talk too much. I'm quieter now.\
Funny how that goes.

He laughed because I mostly wore school clothes\
although that's all I had. I dress better now.\
Funny how that goes.

Sharp insults cut my mother and father\
until they bled. They have scars now.\
Funny how that goes.

Those sticks and stones may break my bones\
but at least they'll never haunt me.\
(Funny how that goes.)
