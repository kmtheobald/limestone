In audience with the Black Lady\
Unsure man I am, a choice to make:\
Before Her Majesty, to lay low\
or against the yolk of fate to shake.

While easy it is to stay in the void\
And easy it is to let leaders lead,\
no head is without voice -- urging bleed.

Looking upon the cards dealt to me\
and those I've passed, a question in mind:\
What charming power defeats all suitors --\
What luring diamond will affect crime?

A queen's hand they hold at distance and\
sheriffs spy with quick draws of distrust.\
Which moment to break -- decide I must.

In this game of hearts, heartless and cruel,\
Where win is all and nothing to lose,\
To make the lady mine, she'll be mine,\
A reckless act of daring to do:

Up to the sky, aim my pistol high,\
For her folly, every trick hums tune --\
Lucid my eye,\
my finger it cries!\
"Go ahead and try\
to shoot the moon."
