You sit around wondering just when\
you'll do this, get to that, or go there --\
Always further down and always then --\
When if you'd just walk, you'd get some where. 

Better to accept\
Although some forget\
That waking dreams suffocate from fret\
And conversely excite\
Nay, those dreams ignite\
When mind's shadow moves them from the light. 

The best concern not with what the future brings\
because Beautiful people love Beautiful things\
Whereever one is, the other you'll find\
'Tis true now and 'tis true for all of time.
