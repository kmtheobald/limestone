This adult pace won't let me breathe.\
How, ever more and more, I snit and seethe.\

Out and about, my body rushed,\
Mind frenetic, my cheeks are flushed,\

I wildly dream of them, this much I notice,\
Faraway, towering plants and verdant forest.\

To walk within, not knowing day or night,\
enthralled by boredom, never marked by time.\

I have responsibilities, I know, I know,\
and that is why I will not go.\

Imagination will have to suffice\
and you, dear friend, understanding and nice.\

My one wish -- to lose myself in the graze,\
so hopelessly gone in an endless maze --\

As deep, deep down as human feelings lay,\
To then finally pause at once and say:\

"I should like to sit here, beneath this tree,\
to rest and think my thoughts, just it and me."\
