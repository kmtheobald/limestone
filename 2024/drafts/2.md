Why, the world is out there and I oughta go see it
Really, I bet it's quite a show

I imagine, imagine what it must be like
So much so that I joke that I know

Know why he does this and she does that
Him and her whom I've never met

Because this little box up top is all I've got
And certainly all that I'll ever get

Whether I'm here or there or anyplace
Or even sitting in my living room chair

There's but one difference between good and evil
And it's those who live by fair is fair

I really do mean it, I really do
It's gotta be dandy to *experience*

But the world's been equally changed
by those great people who've done merely this:

A step, one, two
A cry, boohoo

A hand for the weak
A kiss on the cheek

A laugh from a friend
A bone on the mend

A flower in the soil
A plow and some toil

A hope to the sky and
A thought about why
