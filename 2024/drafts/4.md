The world is not me\
and yet it is me\
what I see\
what I think\
how I feel. 

If I could escape,\
if just for a night,\
I would love to laugh\
and dance in another's mind.

But I will remain partner-less\
alone in this one ballroom,\
where in wait\
I must always occupy.

A man must learn to dance\
on the outside of his thoughts



when the air gets stale,\
when the static is stifling,\
the best remedy I find\
is to open a window,\
or, better yet, two.
