If we move, it's because we understand\
those three laws which govern our bodies:\
every action invokes an equal and opposite reaction,\
force is proportional to acceleration, and\
what is at rest tends to remain at rest while\
what is in motion tends to remain in motion. 

And if we fly, it's because we understand\
those four forces against our frame:\
what carries us up,\
what presses us down.\
what propels us forth, and\
what pushes us back.

In order to take flight, a plane and its pilot\
must mean it.\
In order to take flight, a man and his mind\
must mean it.

You may ask the bird, but really,\
high in the air,\
with nary a care\
about you and your circumstances,\
the bird asks you:\
What is your force?\
What is your reaction?
