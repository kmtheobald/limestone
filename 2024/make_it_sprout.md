Those faces seen in black and white\
And eyes surmised and dirty land\
Now far away from this orphan land\
Whilst we so bask in borrowed light.

Our light that's theirs; their hallowed might\
to build a world dug out from sand\
to build it well lest we, unmanned,\
with greedy mouths take out a bite.

I glance within for them without\
and ask what life I have to lend;\
what brick to lay and metal bend,\
and words to others I can shout.

I have but my short height to tout\
but on their shoulders I am let --\
to whom I owe a great, great debt --\
to take some sand and make it sprout.
