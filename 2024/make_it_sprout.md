Those faces seen in black and white\
With eyes surmised and dirty hands;\
Now, far away from this orphaned land\
Whilst we so bask in borrowed light.

Our light that's theirs; their hallowed might\
to build a world dug out from sand\
to build it well lest we, unmanned,\
with greedy mouths take out a bite.

I search within for them without\
and ask what life have I to lend;\
what brick to lay and metal bend\
or words to others I can shout?

I have but my short height to tout\
but on their shoulders I am let --\
to whom I owe a great, great debt --\
to grab some sand and make it sprout.
