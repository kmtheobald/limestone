What of the sinners and what of their sleet,
so strewn about the graceful ground with glee?
Their shame in risking fright and risking freeze
unto this world which offers sight to see.
It's us, full of fire; who warms the earth? We,
with care and giving light, do grow all trees
to rise and build our worth o'er land and sea --
to shun decay and blight which lead to flee.
Gospel of wealth of mind -- to love all things --
however gasps at such gross thoughts we think
As if an angel never fell, nor beamed
a demon upward toward this street to sweep.
Saint or sinner, our descent from Eve
expels expulsion, by this great decree.
