What of the sinners and what of their sleet,\
so strewn about the graceful ground with glee?\
Their shame in risking fright and risking freeze\
unto this world which gifts us sight to see.\
It's us, full of fire. Who warms the earth? We,\
with care and giving light, do grow all trees\
to rise and build our worth o'er land and sea\
and shun decay and blight, which lead to flee.\
Gospel of wealth of mine -- to love all things --\
however gasps at such gross thoughts I think,\
As if an angel never fell, nor beamed\
a demon upward toward this street to sweep.\
Saint or sinner, our deep descent from Eve\
expels expulsion from the good man's creed.
