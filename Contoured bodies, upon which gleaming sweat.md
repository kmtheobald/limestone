silently explains our past, our present, and
our future - not necessarily to construct,
after all, but certainly to build.

In our most important life events, we are naked.
By volition or force, a humility before providence
is demanded -- indeed, it's only price.

There is a young child at your side, pulling
on you, asking,
in search of one answer should you know,
"Do you have clarity?"
If she is so precocious, she might add,
in defiance of the innumerable men and women who've died
in vain attempt of discovery,
"Dear sir, what is your clarity?"
