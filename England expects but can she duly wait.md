England expects but can she duly wait\
for man's true gold to for country gild,\
And not his soul to geld nor resolve shake\
Upon roar of cannon and death heart filled?\
Does she expect without proper toll paid\
his fruits of labour, life and limb for free\
Citizen owe what citizen know, what\
he gained and shown as a young Shropshire lad.\
A peaceful man, born under arms of dove\
That he may want, that he may need to show\
A flower bloomed through sun and drops of love.\

England expects but can't she blindly see\
the outcome of man's true destiny - to fight,\
conquer, vanquish for his daft love of thee\
O England, how you've raised and captured me.\

England expects but could she duly wait\
for man's true gold to his country gild,\
and not his soul to geld nor his resolve shake\
under cannon roar, heart unfulfilled?\
Would she require his fruits of labour, life\
and limb\

He understands what there is to lose--\
Citizen knows exactly what he owes--\
But providence leaves but no choice to choose\
From sword or gunpowder. Rather, the rose.\

England expects but mustn't blindly see\
the outcome of man's true destiny - to fight,\
conquer, vanquish for his daft love of thee\
O England, how you've raised - and captured - me.\
