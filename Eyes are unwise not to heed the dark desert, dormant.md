Ears have no fears that no more hark
The black region of space in the other direction
Without any semblance of soul nor heart.

Mind dares not consider what may lurk within
Or worse, a vast nothing it cannot comprehend.
Brushed up against the void,
The pitied vacuum of sorrow and sin,
Arms shiver in fright; legs in cold do bend.

Decided all to turn the other cheek
Figured eyes what is invisible must be meek
Mistaken ears what is silent must be weak

None amongst them bold enough to touch
Left they the tenebrous to endure unknown;
Be it forever, be it always
That dark desert, dormant remained alone.

Oh, but if eyes had tried!
Odes are sung to those flown in air or sailed by sea.
Bells are rung for heroes who conquered the abyss.
Portraits hung of champions who hath explored.

Treasure would belong to the body brave to enter --
Glory bestowed on the one who finally saw.
But since nobody, noone breached the barrier,
Became the desert red in tooth and claw.

Eyes are unwise not to heed the dark desert, dormant
Ears imprudent not to listen
For it is exactly the spot you least expect
Wherein a Big Bang is released.

Little did eyes know, little could they see
All that was and all that is, all that will ever be,
Had been contained in just a speck, impossibly small to see.

What was hidden in the desert
What was obscured by the dark
Now exploded at once and for eternity.

No longer can eyes look in the other direction
complaining that it is empty.

Instead, all around, as a testament of will,
they shall behold the wrath of the past forgotten:
The flames that lick,
the sound that deafens
the light that blinds
A hell borne of fury.

But also arisen from a burst of energy begotten:
A flower grown,
A sound of music,
A light of sight
Heaven for everybody.
