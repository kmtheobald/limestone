I never told you that Gauss woke me up one morning
And he convinced me I knew who I was going to marry
That very same day Euler appeared before me,
Forewarning the burden I was to carry

We could start anew, or even begin the same way
(what with) Dominoes stripping away our protections one by one
(oh don't you remember) Betty keeping watch outside the door
Hand in hand riding and walking along the lakeside
(I'll wear those) flowery pajamas from the thrift store

Let us ride along the lakefront
Drive toward the cabin, away from it all
Let us make Japanese dumplings
Remember beautiful summer, forget crumbling fall
(one last time)

No, but of course, that is dead and gone, you see
Belonging to two ghosts somehow resembling us
Murdered by jackals out in the distance
Mocking us for who we couldn't be

Sometimes I wish I could burn down a peony garden
I wish I could forget that you ever happened
I wish this world didn't feel so fucking old
A memory of who we were back then

Oh, what did it mean? What did it all mean to you?
Was it just an explosion kicking up some fun in the air?
I knoe what it didn't mean, I know what it wasn't
It wasn't love, those words branded on my soul, ever since you told me to take care

You are my Eden, taunting me as I sink into grief
We began as a dream, fending off demons from every which where
An expression of defeat this song is, my hope for any sharp relief
An admission about our story, how it turned into a nightmare

Strangers once before, strangers once again
Eternal August, I await you, from now until my coffin
