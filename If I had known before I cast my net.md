If I had known before I cast my net\
That words were mighty fleeing, would I let lift\
My sails to breach the wind, my boat adrift?\
Without a catch, my mind’s begun to fret –\
In search went I in folly, soul un-whet,\
But with a dream of letters, ready to sift\
The water wide for its glorious gift (and)\
Return what song to me has given yet.\

Yes.\

Despite what drought of verse I cannot reap\
From oceans ‘cept those feet of other’s glory,\
In want of drink, my net I once more steep\
So that upon my journey back to shore (from)\
This deadly sea of language far and deep\
I will’ve done the poet’s need – defy, explore. (my sole?)\
