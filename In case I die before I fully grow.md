and reach the height I was born bright to see
Please bury me deep beneath the willow
where sadness seeps from roots of destiny.
I want to sleep beside the wind, whistling,
rather than tall sequoias strong and proud
whose girthy trunks bestow successful rings
or pyramids for kings and queens endowed.
I do not mind a humble resting place.
I do not mind from Death a pitied kiss.
Serene the weeping tree who hides her face
as I with the years fade to nothingness.
However, I yet live and rise to show
how high to the skies I intend to go.
