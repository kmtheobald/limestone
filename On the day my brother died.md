I shrunk six inches
And sunk into the ground
Against its dry roots, twisted

But one year later to the hour
I grew back, plus six more,
Like those fields of wildflowers
He and I wandered long before

Rather than laying still and low
He'd've liked I rose tall
In the whistle of the night
I hear his (whispered) loving call
