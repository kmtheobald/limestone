On way to Styx, along a struggling creek\
that parts in two a glade, what's not but seems\
afloat appeared to me who didn't seek:\
a ladder Jacob only saw in dreams.\

Far I must've wandered, from home to there,\
that wood that looked to me not so divine.\
I thought to climb without an ounce of care and\
go satisfy my whim, defiance mine.\

What dose of waking luck! To meet my maker --\
Stories to swap with Him and friends to greet.\
To pass the pearly gates, oh I forsake\
my sins, oh blessed am I to take a seat!\

Trumpets sounded, seraphim flapped in line\
With welcome arms, to announce my arrive.\
But snarling smiles soon traced their lips as sign\
And what seemed safe suddenly seemed a hive.\

And low, beneath my sole, a current passed\
as if the creek knew: drunken ballads sung,\
maidens kissed, and soft sounds of steps on grass --\
Impulsive doubt then stayed my foot from the rung.\

All that glitters, I reasoned with a shrug in\
that wood that looked to me not do divine.\
On way to Styx, I walked a happy man\
And back I'll walk no matter what I find.\

Knowing of holly thorned and wrath of God\
Judgement that I feel isn't His to hold\
For another, light above or maybe rod\
For me, I keep this Earth -- its dirt, its gold.\
