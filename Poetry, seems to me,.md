Poetry, seems to me,\
form of philosophy,\
parallel but opposed.\

Seeking to understand\
how great trees greet man and\
how colors learn to glow.\

To ask pensive questions\
with silk and suggestion\
from melody's palace.\

A chance, I think, to drink,\
as my concerns do sink,\
from the wooden chalice.\

If Plato had just stopped\
mourning shadows on rock,\
he'd've known to love dark.\

Our fire breathes licks of light\
While the sun blinds too bright\
And outside the cave lacks spark.\
