Despair, a sign of those who go below
Although you're lost - be found - you'll be okay.

Heroic hearts can keep the wolves at bay
A show of faith can silence cawing crows
Remember well that we suffice to pray.

Tomorrow's sky will bring a sunny day
And our mistakes today no one will know
From death - alive again - you'll be okay.

A change of fate by love's assured embrace
Allows the soul to flourish wide and grow
Remember well that we suffice to pray.

The youth, in hubris, sin fast as they may
With age, the prodigal reap what they've sown
Once far away - return - you'll be okay.

The blessed are meant to pardon anyway
They linger not on our past faults nor woes
Remember well that we suffice to say
"I judge that all is well - I'll be okay."
