A few deep breaths
Not much longer
This too shall pass

Use short words now
No need to waste
Lay down your tongue
Leave it to taste

Keep it simple
And make it rhyme
Relax yourself
Don't lose your mind

Take your sweet time
Release that stress
If you feel tired
Lie down and rest

Shortly some quiet
It's not a test
Say sweet nothings
You are the best
