With the honking of horns and the
stomping of feet,
With the flapping of wings and the
clinking of glasses,
the rhythm is never interrupted.
It slows across the din of concrete and
It softens when the sinners shout but
the rhythm is never interrupted.

The beat must next be seen.
A painter's canvas,
a hermit tanless,
Red sands a-heat,
Bedlands of peet,
all show the melody (dull
in a grey suit, but sharp
at the end of a rainbow).
With the writing of words and the
monuments built of stone and brick,
the beat displays its color.

The lastly feat, to feel the beat, requires sacrifice.
The arm must break, the heart must bleed
to greet that sweet sensation.
In the boxing ring of life, the beat finds itself
in the Poet's corner.
But all around us, all through us, all in us it emanates
liminally, even if you don't meet it.
The clocks know it, just ask them.
The gravestones know it, just ask them.
