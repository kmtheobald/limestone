Abound are pens and paper blank
A multitude of faces bright
Attention pulses forth in wait

There's excitement in the air
Nary a person with a care
All who came to see the fare
You, the next great poet.

3

Have now no fear
We'll lend you our ears
If we can only hear
You, the next great poet.

5

Up you go to the stage
Now released from your cage
Knowing life's but a page (is)
You, the next great poet.
