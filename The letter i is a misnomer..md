The letter i is a misnomer\
Imaginary numbers well exist and\
encode the ability to translate and rotate\
in two dimensions.\
This is useful in numerous fields of engineering,\
signal processing, aviation, and more.\

Similarly, social imaginary imprints on us in a way\
that you need only live to believe.\
History echoes through time\
Norms echo in our behavior\
Evolution gently suggests our brainwaves, our communication,\
shaping who we are and who we will become.\

The moon is drawn to the Sun via an invisible fabric\
emanating from the intersection of the dimensional forces\
of space and time.\

Need I continue?\
A unicorn you will not see on the street, but\
A unicorn we meet in our slumbering dreams.\

We are drawn to each other through this thing called love\
and we want to hug, kiss, and spend our lives with each other.\

How Riemann saw numbers is\
how the matter and the universe like to self-organize:\
A compact sphere formed from zero to infinity.\

If you tell me about impossibilities and inexistence,\
I'll tell you which bar you can meet you can meet the number one,\
drinking a pint.\
I'll tell you where is love's address in case you need \
to have a chat.\

Imaginary things are perfectly real\
As Gods and children know and wildly feel;\
If you can't make use of what isn't there,\
Do you expect our (hidden) world to really care?\
