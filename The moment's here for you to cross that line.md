The moment's here for you to cross that line\
The gun's been shot; you have to start the race\
So never mind this fear, this is your time.\

A tepid step impresses a calm creek.\

Does God show mercy to those in doubt?\
Who will remain when all the lights go out?\

Which word will speak what the heart feels?\
