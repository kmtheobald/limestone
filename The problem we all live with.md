The problem we all live with\
Oh, those words sprayed all over the walls\
Oh, its the problem we all live with\
Hardly none of us may stand tall\
Oh, it's the money that goes somewhere\
Exactly where, none of us may know\

Optimized\
Financialized\
Contribute, or be demonized\

Humility\
Humidity\
Virility\
Virality\

Lately Sprung Up in America\
Destruction of our Muses\
King Cotton (has become) King Cash\
Nobody knows what the truth is\

And's thats our show for y'all tonight\
Be sure to forget everything before tomorrow\
That's the American way, baby\
