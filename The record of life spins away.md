Yet I remain stuck in a groove.
No ceremony; the same loop.
Would not I give it all to skate
To different times or a farther place.

The outer rings would soothe my mind
Where there I know the sound soon stops
Save homely skips and clicks and pops.
Perhaps a friend would be so kind
And flip me to my second side.

Began the music with such verve
That I mourn those tunes full before;
As I ready to be no more.
For the last act takes most the nerve:
To lift the needle from the curve.
