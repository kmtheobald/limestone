The second branch above the ground has perched\
a raven plumed with yellow feathers, bright.\
The tree it sits atop is yew, without\
decor. It recognizes all by sight.\
A youngling once approached and never saw\
again the light of day nor dark of night.\

Emotion calls some people forth in pain\
to learn what knows the bird that looks like sun.\
A cautious man may live, others will die,\
and none the wiser he who hid and won.\
This dandelion beast atop the yew\
brings peace as bullets do shot from a gun.\
