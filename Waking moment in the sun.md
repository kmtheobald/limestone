To bask, to soak, to bake

Youth shapes into wine
Her slow sense of time
With her cunning, what
Dial could hope to divine?

Arcs ache down to Earth
And water suffers dark

The pools all close at dusk
And moments die as they must
It's time curse, that we
Soon crawl after thrust.

-----
This warmth may one day frost
In shadow of winds finally crossed
But allay your nights now suffocate
still from heat.

Rays trace against the sky, scraping
They conspire to stoke the fire, great ball
that carries your days, suspended in space.

Sidewalk frying, sand scorching,
your feet let you know you're alive!
