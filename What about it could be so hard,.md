What about it could be so hard,\
To express how you feel?\
The world awaits your first song, they're\
eager for the reveal.\

What more do you have left to lose?\
After all, there are worse;\
you, a shining beacon among\
the profane and the cursed.\

What are you really afraid of?\
Not those fools now who roam;\
Out you go, into the nowhere --\
Go write yourself a poem.\
