With grit to climb just one more step\
along the slope, beside the drop\
where fallen many men to ebb.\

The peak, mirage, a land of stop\
to journeymen unable yet\
to think of gentle gold up top.\

Against oneself this trudge a bet --\
Who wins between soul and mind?\
The soul knows more but soul has debt.\

From now to then, of ticking time,\
repaid in sweat, through years of prep\
and blood after wind pierced the rind.\

Worry not aching quadricep\
but brave to move just one more step.\
