No, rather, I will stay here down below
Where fog leaves alone my unmeasured mind.
I used to feel hunger for a tight bow
But time's small quiver sates my need for fries
Before, I didn't know a disdain of winter
Even now noone swears at a long storm's wake
Spring's measure, however, is made of tin
Which is much stronger than a snow boot's cake.
I asked Love's advice and she gave a spin --
"Dreams do not awake if you live up high
Nor when you ponder how to tie a tie
They leave their earthly shadows, eyes unblinked,
With shirts untucked and gospel drawn in pink."
