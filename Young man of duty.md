Grown up by force
Three months, Ma can't make rent
Sis is smoking, pregnant

Stomach empty, but not for long,
'cause, you say, this boy's gonna eat
Mind full, but not for long,
'cause, you know, the brain's gotta eat

On the porch, grass won't grow
Look out and all you see is dirt
You know now, not to cry
Though it won't stop the hurt

Listen child, listen close
You wait for instructions, they won't come
Questions loom, questions doom
What will you do? Where will you go?

If I were three-and-ten again
I would say to the sky, cloudy
not yet rained
with all my might, loudly

"I will do what you ask
I will go where you require"
Walk away
While instructions watch behind the wire.
